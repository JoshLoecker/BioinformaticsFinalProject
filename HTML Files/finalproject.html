			<h2><u>
				Overview
			</u></h2>
			<p>
				As human lifespan increases, the potential for mistakes to occur during cell replication also
				increases. Due to the increase in quality of life, especially in America, cancer has become the leading
				cause of death. In 2012 alone, there were "14.1 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths
				worldwide" (Cancer Statistics). As the cases of cancer rises worldwide, mortality rates rise with it.
				However, as cancer has become a more prevalent disease in our everyday lives, we have developed better
				testing methods to follow.
			</p>

			<p>
				The CDC has collected data from each state from 1999 to 2016 on the incidence of cancer and moratlity from it.
				The data is available for download <a
					href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/uscs/dataviz/download_data.htm" target="_blank">at this link</a>;
				in addition, the CDC has created their own visualizations. These graphs are available
				<a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/DataViz.html" target="_blank">here</a>. However, the graphs
				availabe on
				thir website
				only consist of data from 2016. The graphs below encompass all incidence and mortality rates from 1999 to 2016
				for all races.
				<br />
				<br />
			</p>


			<h2><u>General Data Analysis</u></h2>
			<p>
				Much of the analysis here is the same; California has the largest state population in the United States
				at 39 million people. Texas follows second at 29 million people , and Florida coming in third at 21 million
				people. As a result, higher numbers of people mean a higher incidence and mortality rate of cancer. This
				can be seen in every graph shown below, with California, Texas, and Florida outmatching nearly every other
				state. In some cases New York shows a presence.
				
				<br />
				<br />
				The first map shows an incidence rate for both males and females, for all races. California has the highest
				incidence rate at approximately 826,000 cases since 1999; Florida follows with just under 610,000 incidence
				rates. While California has a much higher total incidence rate, a simple explanation for this is that their
				population is much higher than any other state.
				
				<br />
				<br />
				The second map shows the mortality rate for males and females of all races. Again, California has the highest
				mortality rate at approximately 293,000 deaths. Much like incidence rate, this is most easily explained because
				the California population is much higher than that of other states. Following incidence rate trends, Florida
				has the second highest mortality rate.  Since more incidences of cancer most likely result in more deaths,
				it makes sense that California and Florida take the top two spots for deaths caused by cancer.
				<br />
				Each map uses the same scale for easier representation of results.

			<h2><u>Statistical Tests</u></h2>
			<p>
		
				An ANOVA test was performed using Python's SciPy library on incidence and mortality rate. This test
				was used to compare the variances in the mean between male and female incidence rate, along with male
				and female mortality rate. Examining the p-value (shown below) of these results can be used to compare
				determine if a statistical difference is present between male and female rates of cancer, and deaths
				due to cancer. Two hypothesis exist for the data I have presented; these are shown below.
				<br />
				Null hypothesis 1: Male and female <u>incidence</u> rates are statistically similar
				<br />
				Null hypothesis 2: Male and female <u>mortality</u> rates are statistically similar
				
				<br />
				<br />
				When looking at the data sets for incidence and mortality between men and women, the number of people
				in each set is not extremely different. From 1999 to 2016, slightly more men have both been diagnosed
				with cancer and died from it. This is a reasonable outcome, as there are slightly more males in the
				population than females (Smirnova).
				
				<br />
				<br />
				The results of each test can be seen in the ANOVA Test table. The p-value for both incidence rate and
				mortality is far above 0.05; because of this, it can be concluded that no statistical difference
				exists in the incidence	or death of cancer between men and women.
				<br />
				An error that may come into play for the ANOVA test is that the rates of cancer may not be normally
				distributed; if the average age of incidence is significantly different, the ANOVA test is not
				suitable for analysis.
				<br />

				The following diagram is called a Sankey Plot, and it looks a little deeper into the "Data Sets"
                table above. It is relatively intuitive for understanding where numbers are coming from, or where
                they are going.

        <div class="alignLeft">
            <p>
                It is much easier to see from the Sankey Plot that the incidence and mortality rate between men and
                women is very small. Hovering over any portion of the graph will show an interactive that
                represents the number of people belonging to said group.
                <br />
                Hovering over the gray bar next to "Total Incidence and Mortality" shows that approximately 11.1
                million people are represented in this diagram; 5.46 million are females, and the remaining 5.66
                million are men. From here, females have 4.06 million individuals that have been diagnosed from
                cancer, but have not died from it. The remaining 1.4 million have unfortunately passed away.
                <br />
                On the male side, an almost-equivalent number of diagnoses have been documented as females, at 4.11
                million incidences. Along these same lines, more men have also died due to cancer, at 1.55 million
                deaths. As explained previously, this difference is due to an ever-so-slightly higher male-to-female
                population.

                <br />
                Due to the vast population differences between the U.S. states, the values for the incidence rate in
                the following boxplot have been standardized. This allows the incidence rates between the states to
                be compared much more easily. This was done by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the
                population. Once this was done, the mean was subtracted from the incidence rate of each state, then
                divided by the standard deviation. In the U.S. map above, California, Texas, and Florida were the
                most prominent in all cases (female incidence, male mortality, etc.). In the case of California, it
                has an incidence rate 3.95 standard deviations higher than average, and Florida has an incidence rate
                2.66 standard deviations higher than average. As stated earlier, this is most likey attributed to
                higher populations in both of these states.
                
                <br />
                standardization formula: New Value = (Old Value - Mean) / std. dev
                
                <br />
                Note: Unfortunately, I was unable to show hovering data for Q1, mean, Q3, etc. This is the reason for
                showing them in the table.

                This was a fun project to put together. While I did not know much about statistics, I feel I
                have learned very much here, even if some of the figures are wrongly interpreted. I had many
                challanges to solve during the creation of this project, and it was a small victory each time I
                overcame one of them.
