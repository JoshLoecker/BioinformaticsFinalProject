			<h2><u>
				Overview
			</u></h2>
			<p>
				As human lifespan increases, the potential for mistakes to occur during cell replication also
				increases. Due to the increase in quality of life, especially in America, cancer has become the leading
				cause of death. In 2012 alone, there were "14.1 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths
				worldwide" (Cancer Statistics). As the cases of cancer rises worldwide, mortality rates rise with it.
				However, as cancer has become a more prevalent disease in our everyday lives, we have developed better
				testing methods to follow.
			</p>

			<p>
				The CDC has collected data from each state from 1999 to 2016 on the incidence of cancer and moratlity from it.
				The data is available for download <a
					href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/uscs/dataviz/download_data.htm" target="_blank">at this link</a>;
				in addition, the CDC has created their own visualizations. These graphs are available
				<a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/DataViz.html" target="_blank">here</a>. However, the graphs
				availabe on
				thir website
				only consist of data from 2016. The graphs below encompass all incidence and mortality rates from 1999 to 2016
				for all races.
				<br />
				<br />
			</p>


			<h2><u>General Data Analysis</u></h2>
			<p>
				Much of the analysis here is the same; California has the largest state population in the United States
				at 39 million people. Texas follows second at 29 million people , and Florida coming in third at 21 million
				people. As a result, higher numbers of people mean a higher incidence and mortality rate of cancer. This
				can be seen in every graph shown below, with California, Texas, and Florida outmatching nearly every other
				state. In some cases New York shows a presence.
				
				<br />
				<br />
				The first map shows an incidence rate for both males and females, for all races. California has the highest
				incidence rate at approximately 826,000 cases since 1999; Florida follows with just under 610,000 incidence
				rates. While California has a much higher total incidence rate, a simple explanation for this is that their
				population is much higher than any other state.
				
				<br />
				<br />
				The second map shows the mortality rate for males and females of all races. Again, California has the highest
				mortality rate at approximately 293,000 deaths. Much like incidence rate, this is most easily explained because
				the California population is much higher than that of other states. Following incidence rate trends, Florida
				has the second highest mortality rate.  Since more incidences of cancer most likely result in more deaths,
				it makes sense that California and Florida take the top two spots for deaths caused by cancer.
				<br />
				Each map uses the same scale for easier representation of results.

			<h2><u>Statistical Tests</u></h2>
			<p>
		
				An ANOVA test was performed using Python's SciPy library on incidence and mortality rate. This test
				was used to compare the variances in the mean between male and female incidence rate, along with male
				and female mortality rate. Examining the p-value (shown below) of these results can be used to compare
				determine if a statistical difference is present between male and female rates of cancer, and deaths
				due to cancer. Two hypothesis exist for the data I have presented; these are shown below.
				<br />
				Null hypothesis 1: Male and female <u>incidence</u> rates are statistically similar
				<br />
				Null hypothesis 2: Male and female <u>mortality</u> rates are statistically similar
				
				<br />
				<br />
				When looking at the data sets for incidence and mortality between men and women, the number of people
				in each set is not extremely different. From 1999 to 2016, slightly more men have both been diagnosed
				with cancer and died from it. This is a reasonable outcome, as there are slightly more males in the
				population than females (Smirnova).
				
				<br />
				<br />
				The results of each test can be seen in the ANOVA Test table. The p-value for both incidence rate and
				mortality is far above 0.05; because of this, it can be concluded that no statistical difference
				exists in the incidence	or death of cancer between men and women.
				<br />
				An error that may come into play for the ANOVA test is that the rates of cancer may not be normally
				distributed; if the average age of incidence is significantly different, the ANOVA test is not
				suitable for analysis.
