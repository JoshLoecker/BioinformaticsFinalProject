			<h2><u>
				Overview
			</u></h2>
			<p>
				As human lifespan increases, the potential for mistakes to occur during cell replication also
				increases. Due to the increase in quality of life, especially in America, cancer has become the leading
				cause of death. In 2012 alone, there were "14.1 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths
				worldwide" (Cancer Statistics). As the cases of cancer rises worldwide, mortality rates rise with it.
				However, as cancer has become a more prevalent disease in our everyday lives, we have developed better
				testing methods to follow.
			</p>

			<p>
				The CDC has collected data from each state from 1999 to 2016 on the incidence of cancer and moratlity from it.
				The data is available for download <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/uscs/dataviz/download_data.htm">at this link</a>;
				in addition, the CDC has created their own visualizations. These graphs are available
				<a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/DataViz.html">here</a>. However, the graphs availabe on thir website
				only consist of data from 2016. The graphs below encompass all incidence and mortality rates from 1999 to 2016
				for all races.
				<br />
				<br />
			</p>


			<h2><u>General Data Analysis</u></h2>
			<p>
				Much of the analysis here is the same; California has the largest state population in the United States
				at 39 million people. Texas follows second at 29 million people , and Florida coming in third at 21 million
				people. As a result, higher numbers of people mean a higher incidence and mortality rate of cancer. This
				can be seen in every graph shown below, with California, Texas, and Florida outmatching nearly every other
				state. In some cases New York shows a presence.
			</p>

			<h4>Total Incidence Rate</h4>
			<p>
				The first map shows an incidence rate for both males and females, for all races. California has the highest
				incidence rate at approximately 826,000 cases since 1999; Florida follows with just under 610,000 incidence
				rates. While California has a much higher total incidence rate, a simple explanation for this is that their
				population is much higher than any other state.

			<h4> <br /> Total Mortality Rate</h4>
			<p>
				The second map shows the incidence rate for males and females of all races. Again, California has the highest
				mortality rate at approximately 293,000 deaths. Much like incidence rate, this is most easily explained because
				the California population is much higher than that of other states. Following incidence rate trends, Florida
				has the second highest mortality rate.  Since more incidences of cancer most likely result in more deaths,
				it makes sense that California and Florida take the top two spots for deaths caused by cancer.

			<h2><u>Statistical Tests</u></h2>
			<p>
				A t-test was performed using Python's SciPy library on incidence rate and mortality rate. A t-test allows
				to compare the average values between two datasets, and determine if there is a statistical difference
				between the sets. In this case, the null hypothesis for each data set can be seen in the table below.


				<span class="tableLayout">
					<table align="center" border="1px" cellpadding="5px">
						<tr>
							<th></th>
							<th>Incidence Rate</th>
							<th>Mortality Rate</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>Null Hypothesis</th>
							<th>Male and female rates are statistically <span class="blueFont">similar</span> </th>
							<th>Male and female rates are statistically <span class="blueFont">similar</span> </th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>Alternate Hypothesis</th>
							<th>Male and female rates are statistically <span class="redFont">different</span> </th>
							<th>Male and female rates are statistically <span	class="redFont">different</span> </th>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</span>


				<br />
				<br />
				The results of each test can be seen in the following tables. The p-value for the incidene rate shows
				that the average incidence is statistically different between men and women, because the p-value is
				greater than 0.05. On the other hand, the p-value for mortality rate between men and women is
				statistically similar because the p-value is far less than 0.05.
				<br />
				When looking at the data sets for incidence and mortality between men and women, the number of people
				in each set is not extremely different; there is actually a larger disparity between mortality in men
				and women than there is in the incidence rate.
				These values show that cancer occurs at a different rate between men and women, but both men and
				women die at a similar rate.
